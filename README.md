# PLAN-TER

The goal of this app is to provide a fluid interface for gardeners to plan out their planting aspirations, see a rough preview of how the layout will appear, make notes on plants throughout the growing season, and save their annual layouts to look back on.

## What problem does this solve?

Planning out a garden can require a lot of experience-based knowledge and intuition. It can also be hard to remember what plants are where, especially when they are young and might not survive. When planning out a prairie or flower bed, it can be hard to track when plants bloom (continuous blooming is important for pollinators) or if colors and textures will be cohesive. I want to be able to plan out my garden and preview its progression through the season. I also want to be able to make notes on plants throughout their growth, and look back on previous years' layouts to assess what did or did not work.

## Goals

The user can:
-store the dimensions of their yard and any gardening plots or pots and see these rendered on the DOM
-create a library of plants with important info (e.g. sunlight, soil type, flower time and color, etc)
-create an annual garden plan, with time of plants planted and their coordinates
-play an animation of their garden progressing through the growing season
-take notes on specific plants, groups of plants or whole plots
-review previous layouts and notes

## Technical Breakdown

I would like this project to be a way to learn new languages and skills, but I don't want to be too bogged down learning and not writing. For frontend I am most comfortable in React, and while I'm very interested in TypeScript, I'm currently learning HTML5 CANVAS for images and animation, and it's already a lot. The plant animations will be low-res, maybe a Stardew Valley aesthetic. I also have experience with Material UI, but I am much more interested in learning TailwindCSS for styling. For backend, I will probably use Node/Express and PostgreSQL. I am interested in GoLang, but this project seems frontend-heavy, so maybe I should focus my energy there. As a stretch goal, I would like to do a little wikipedia-table scraping with Python to get information about companion planting. There could be suggestions of beneficial plants to group together, or keep apart.
